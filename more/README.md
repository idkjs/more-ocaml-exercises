The 'more' package
==================

This is a local copy of the 'More' module described in the chapter "Our Working
Environment" in the book. It is used by most of the other examples and
exercises.

For your own use, you should consider the OPAM package more-reason, which
installs this. For manual installation, using ocamlfind, on platforms not
supported by OPAM, you may type...

make install

...in this folder, once everything has been built as per the instructions in
the top level directory of this download.
