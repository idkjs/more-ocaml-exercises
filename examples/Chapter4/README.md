Examples for Chapter 4
======================

These examples can be explored either by copying-and-pasting into the OCaml
top-level, or by the prepared top level "example.top":

        OCaml

# Input.input_example ();;
Words read:
there
were
four
of
them
more
than
before
- : unit = ()

The resulting 'input' library built in this directory is also used by several
of the other chapters' examples and exercises.
