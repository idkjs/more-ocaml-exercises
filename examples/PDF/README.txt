PDF Examples
============

The built executable program is "pdfmain". The built top level is
"pdfmain.top".

When either is run, three PDF files are built:

a) hello.pdf - the "Hello, World" example from the text

b) graph.pdf - the graph paper example from the text

c) hello3.pdf - a three-page version of "Hello, World", which is the answer to
Question 2 in Chapter 14

The directory "text" contains the example from Chapter 16.

See the text of pdfhello.ml and the other modules for code or the answers to
other questions with the exception of:

a) Chapter 16 q1-q4, which are in exercises/PDF in this download

b) Chapter 14 q3, which is in exercises/PDF in this download

This slightly unorthodox layout is required by the dependencies of the various
modules in use here, and the specific questions and answers. You are advised to
read all the code in each pdf*.ml and pdf*.mli file.
